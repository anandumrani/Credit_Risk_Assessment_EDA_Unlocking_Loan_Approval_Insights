# Credit_Risk_Assessment_EDA_Unlocking_Loan_Approval_Insights
## Business Background
- Challenges in Loan Approval:
	- Loan companies encounter difficulties when lending to individuals with limited or no credit history.
	- Some borrowers exploit this situation by intentionally defaulting on loans.
- Company Focus:
	- You are part of a consumer finance company specializing in lending to urban customers.
	- The objective is to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover data patterns effectively.
- Goal:
	- Identify loan applicants with the ability to repay to avoid rejecting potentially valuable customers.
- Risk Factors:
	- The company faces two primary risks:
	- Rejecting loans for capable applicants results in missed business opportunities.
	- Approving loans for likely defaulters can lead to financial losses.
- Crucial Decision-Making:
	- Balancing these risks is essential in guiding loan approval decisions.

## Business Objectives:
- Identify patterns indicating clients' difficulty with loan payments.
- Use findings for actions like loan denial, reduced loan amounts, or higher interest rates for risky applicants.
- Ensure deserving loan applicants are not rejected.
- Understand key driver variables for loan default.
- Enhance portfolio management and risk assessment.
- Research on risk analytics for deeper domain understanding recommended.

## Recommendations as Outcome of Project:
- Gender: Females are less likely to default and generally men are high risk, especially who get credit between 300K to 600K
- Family: Applicants with few children tend to pay back loans
- Age: Applicants above age of 50 are safest while age group of 20-40 is high risk
- Credit Amount: People (both male and females) who get loan for 300-600k tend to default more than others and hence having higher interest specifically for this credit range would be ideal.
- Loan Purpose: Loan taken for repairs, urgent need and others are having highest defaulters
- Contract Status: 
	- Majority of the prev cancelled applicants have repayed the loan.
	- Lot of people are cancelling or leaving their offers unused. This needs further investigation
